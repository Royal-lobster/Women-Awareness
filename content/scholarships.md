Scholarships for girls in India are meant to encourage better education and career opportunities for females who are yet to match their male counterparts on different socio-economic parameters. Still, if given an opportunity, woman don’t lag behind men either in the professional arena or academics. Here comes the role of women-specific scholarships that encourages them to counter their financial constraints and pursue academic and career opportunities. Of late, many government and private organisations in different fields like science and research, management, aviation,
hospitality and defence have been offering women scholarships and grants towards encouraging the better half of the population to take academic opportunities. Some of these programmes of scholarship for girls include L’Oréal India For Young Women in Science Scholarship, Santoor Women’s Scholarship and Fair and Lovely
Foundation Scholarship.
